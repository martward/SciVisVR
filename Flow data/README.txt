About this data

wervel.vtk: a static vector field that represents the flow field inside a small
simulated tornado. Data origin: example dataset from AVS.

SMRX.vtk: a static vector field that represents the mixing properties of a
static mixing reactor used to mix very viscous fluids. Data origin: Drona
Kandhai, Computational Science research goup of the University of Amsterdam.

carotid-bifurcation: a dynamic flow field that represents the blood flow
through the bifurcating part of the carotid artery under the influence of one
systolic cycle, in eleven discrete time steps. Data origin: Computational
Science research goup of the University of Amsterdam.
